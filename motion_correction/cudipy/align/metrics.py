        A similarity metric is in charge of keeping track of the numerical
        value of the similarity (or distance) between the two given images. It
        also computes the update field for the forward and inverse displacement
        fields to be used in a gradient-based optimization algorithm. Note that
        this metric does not depend on any transformation (affine or
        non-linear) so it assumes the static and moving images are already
        warped

        Parameters
