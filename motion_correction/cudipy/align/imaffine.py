""" Affine image registration module consisting of the following classes:

    AffineMap: encapsulates the necessary information to perform affine
        transforms between two domains, defined by a `static` and a `moving`
        image. The `domain` of the transform is the set of points in the
        `static` image's grid, and the `codomain` is the set of points in
        the `moving` image. When we call the `transform` method, `AffineMap`
        maps each point `x` of the domain (`static` grid) to the codomain
        (`moving` grid) and interpolates the `moving` image at that point
        to obtain the intensity value to be placed at `x` in the resulting
        grid. The `transform_inverse` method performs the opposite operation
        mapping points in the codomain to points in the domain.

    ParzenJointHistogram: computes the marginal and joint distributions of
        intensities of a pair of images, using Parzen windows [Parzen62]
        with a cubic spline kernel, as proposed by Mattes et al. [Mattes03].
        It also computes the gradient of the joint histogram w.r.t. the
        parameters of a given transform.

    MutualInformationMetric: computes the value and gradient of the mutual
        information metric the way `Optimizer` needs them. That is, given
        a set of transform parameters, it will use `ParzenJointHistogram`
        to compute the value and gradient of the joint intensity histogram
        evaluated at the given parameters, and evaluate the the value and
        gradient of the histogram's mutual information.

    AffineRegistration: it runs the multi-resolution registration, putting
        all the pieces together. It needs to create the scale space of the
        images and run the multi-resolution registration by using the Metric
        and the Optimizer at each level of the Gaussian pyramid. At each
        level, it will setup the metric to compute value and gradient of the
        metric with the input images with different levels of smoothing.

        """ AffineMap

        Implements an affine transformation whose domain is given by
        `domain_grid` and `domain_grid2world`, and whose co-domain is
        given by `codomain_grid` and `codomain_grid2world`.

        The actual transform is represented by the `affine` matrix, which
        operate in world coordinates. Therefore, to transform a moving image
        towards a static image, we first map each voxel (i,j,k) of the static
        image to world coordinates (x,y,z) by applying `domain_grid2world`.
        Then we apply the `affine` transform to (x,y,z) obtaining (x', y', z')
        in moving image's world coordinates. Finally, (x', y', z') is mapped
        to voxel coordinates (i', j', k') in the moving image by multiplying
        (x', y', z') by the inverse of `codomain_grid2world`. The
        `codomain_grid_shape` is used analogously to transform the static
        image towards the moving image when calling `transform_inverse`.

        If the domain/co-domain information is not provided (None) then the
        sampling information needs to be specified each time the `transform`
        or `transform_inverse` is called to transform images. Note that such
        sampling information is not necessary to transform points defined in
        physical space, such as stream lines.

        Parameters
        ----------
        affine : array, shape (dim + 1, dim + 1)
            the matrix defining the affine transform, where `dim` is the
            dimension of the space this map operates in (2 for 2D images,
            3 for 3D images). If None, then `self` represents the identity
            transformation.
        domain_grid_shape : sequence, shape (dim,), optional
            the shape of the default domain sampling grid. When `transform`
            is called to transform an image, the resulting image will have
            this shape, unless a different sampling information is provided.
            If None, then the sampling grid shape must be specified each time
            the `transform` method is called.
        domain_grid2world : array, shape (dim + 1, dim + 1), optional
            the grid-to-world transform associated with the domain grid.
            If None (the default), then the grid-to-world transform is assumed
            to be the identity.
        codomain_grid_shape : sequence of integers, shape (dim,)
            the shape of the default co-domain sampling grid. When
            `transform_inverse` is called to transform an image, the resulting
            image will have this shape, unless a different sampling
            information is provided. If None (the default), then the sampling
            grid shape must be specified each time the `transform_inverse`
            method is called.
        codomain_grid2world : array, shape (dim + 1, dim + 1)
            the grid-to-world transform associated with the co-domain grid.
            If None (the default), then the grid-to-world transform is assumed
            to be the identity.

        By default, the transformed image is sampled at a grid defined by
        `self.codomain_shape` and `self.codomain_grid2world`. If such
        information was not provided then `sampling_grid_shape` is mandatory.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image :  2D or 3D array
            the image to be transformed
        interpolation : string, either 'linear' or 'nearest'
            the type of interpolation to be used, either 'linear'
            (for k-linear interpolation) or 'nearest' for nearest neighbor
        image_grid2world : array, shape (dim + 1, dim + 1), optional
            the grid-to-world transform associated with `image`.
            If None (the default), then the grid-to-world transform is assumed
            to be the identity.
        sampling_grid_shape : sequence, shape (dim,), optional
            the shape of the grid where the transformed image must be sampled.
            If None (the default), then `self.codomain_shape` is used instead
            (which must have been set at initialization, otherwise an exception
            will be raised).
        sampling_grid2world : array, shape (dim + 1, dim + 1), optional
            the grid-to-world transform associated with the sampling grid
            (specified by `sampling_grid_shape`, or by default
            `self.codomain_shape`). If None (the default), then the
            grid-to-world transform is assumed to be the identity.
        resample_only : Boolean, optional
            If False (the default) the affine transform is applied normally.
            If True, then the affine transform is not applied, and the input
            image is just re-sampled on the domain grid of this transform.

        -------
        transformed : array, shape `sampling_grid_shape` or
                      `self.codomain_shape`
